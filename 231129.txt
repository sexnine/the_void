i cut myself today

its not unusual to hurt myself, usually i just give myself bruises but not today

i tried to hold back, i really did, i tried but i cant stop myself

im too weak, i have no control

this is my punishment for being so weak

i have no control over myself

im weak

i let myself get fucked with

and for that im weak

i try to control my emotions

but im too fucking weak

im worthless

i see the signs, but im powerless

i cant do anything

and for that im inferior

why why why why why why why why am i so fucking weak

im trapped

it will never get better

i try soo hard

every day

i put in so much effort

i try

but my efforts are fruitless

im destined to be miserable

im not allowed to be happy

every day i forget about the previous, hoping to start anew

i want everything to be okay, i dont want to be miserable

that takes effort, so much effort

i put in that effort

i fucking try

if i show that im weak, ill be abused, ill be taken advantage of

im just a toy

so everyday i try to act okay
but theres only so much i can
do before i fucking lose it



fuck everyone, fuck everything
i hate everyone and everything
fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you and get fucked
