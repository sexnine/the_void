i think im depressed

every day feels the same

i wake up and dont feel right

i feel disconnected from everything and everyone

i cant keep track of the days anymore

nothing feels right

i hate existing

where did everything go wrong?

i feel exhausted, even when ive just woken up

i dont have the mental strength to do anything

i havent done schoolwork in over a week

im useless

what is wrong with me ?
